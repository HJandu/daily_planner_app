## <ins>Background</ins>
Being employed as a software developer, I have been asked to develop an app for employees with a busy schedule, who can add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.

The Work Day Schedulaer app:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* When the timeblocks are viewed, each timeblock is colour-coded based on past (grey colour), present (red), and future (green).

* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Saves the event in their local storage, when the save button is clicked in that timeblock. <br>

  <br>

* Persists events between refreshes of a page.
  
* A reset button is included to clear local storage each day. When the button is pressed, an alert message appears. <br>
